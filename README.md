## How to Use

### Navigating the Application

- **Home Page**: Shows today's workout by default
- **All Workouts**: Access the complete list of available workouts organized by month

### Selecting a Workout

1. Navigate to the "All Workouts" page to see all available workout dates.
2. Each workout card displays:
   - Date of the workout
   - Workout type (Circuit, AMRAP, Tabata, or EMOM)
   - Total duration
   - Number of exercises
   - List of primary exercises
3. Click on a workout card to select that workout.
4. Review the workout details including type, exercises, and duration.
5. If a workout doesn't exist for a specific date, you'll be directed to the "All Workouts" page.

### During a Workout

1. Press the "Start" button to begin the workout.
2. The timer will guide you through:
   - Warm-up sections
   - Main workout with appropriate intervals based on the workout type
   - Cool-down sections
3. For each exercise:
   - The current exercise name is prominently displayed
   - A progress bar shows time remaining
   - Audio cues signal transitions between exercises

### Workout Types

- **Circuit**: Follow the sequence of exercises for the specified number of rounds
- **AMRAP**: Complete as many rounds as possible within the time limit
- **Tabata**: Perform exercises for short work intervals (typically 20 seconds) followed by brief rest periods (typically 10 seconds)
- **EMOM**: Perform the specified exercise at the beginning of each minute, then rest for the remainder of the minute

### Adding Custom Workouts

Custom workouts can be added by creating JSON files in the `src/data/workouts/YYYY/MM/` directory structure. Each workout should follow the established format for the specific workout type:

```json
{
  "type": "circuit",
  "warmUp": [
    { "name": "Jumping Jacks", "duration": 30 }
  ],
  "workout": {
    "exercises": [
      { "name": "Push-ups", "duration": 45 },
      { "name": "Rest", "duration": 15 }
    ],
    "rounds": 3
  },
  "coolDown": [
    { "name": "Stretching", "duration": 60 }
  ]
}
```

## Development

### Project Structure

- `src/app`: Next.js 15 App Router pages, layouts, and API routes
- `src/components`: React components for UI (Navigation, WorkoutTimer, ProgressBar, etc.)
- `src/data`: Workout data organized by date in JSON format (`YYYY/MM/DD.json`)
- `src/workouts`: TypeScript classes implementing different workout types
- `src/utils`: Utility functions for dates, colors, and URL management
- `src/hooks`: Custom React hooks for audio, speech synthesis, and device features

### API Routes

- `GET /api/workouts`: Returns all available workout dates with detailed information
- `GET /api/workouts/[date]`: Returns workout details for a specific date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `GET /api/og`: Generates dynamic OpenGraph images for social sharing with optional date parameter

### URL Structure

The application supports both modern clean URLs and legacy query parameters:

- **Clean URLs**: `/2025/07/05` (preferred)
- **Legacy URLs**: `/?date=2025-07-05` (backwards compatible)
- **Workout List**: `/workouts`

# Linting and Code Quality

This project uses ESLint for code quality and TypeScript for type checking. There are two ESLint configurations:

1. **Production Configuration** (`.eslintrc.json`): A lenient configuration that allows the build to pass even with some warnings or unused variables. This is used for deployment.

2. **Development Configuration** (`.eslintrc.dev.json`): A stricter configuration that catches more issues during development, including unused variables and any types.

## Linting Commands

- `npm run lint`: Run the standard Next.js linting
- `npm run lint:strict`: Run linting with no warnings allowed
- `npm run lint:fix`: Automatically fix linting issues where possible
- `npm run lint:dev`: Run linting with the stricter development configuration
- `npm run typecheck`: Run TypeScript type checking
- `npm run prebuild`: Run both linting and type checking (used before build)

## VS Code Integration

The VS Code settings are configured to use the development ESLint configuration and show linting errors in real-time. This helps catch issues early during development.

## Deployment

For deployment, the production ESLint configuration is used, which is more lenient to allow the build to pass. If you want to deploy with strict linting, you can run `npm run lint:strict` before deploying to catch any issues.
